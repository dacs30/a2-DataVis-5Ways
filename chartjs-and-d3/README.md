# Chart JS and D3

Hello! For this portion of the assignment, I decided to try Chart JS and D3 integration with React. The results were fair, but you will see that Chart JS integrates much easier with modern frameworks than D3.

## Chart JS
The integration was easy and smooth, Chart JS already comes with a responsivity and all I needed to make it work was about 200 lines of code.

## D3
The integration was hard, and I needed to create hooks for it so it would work. I also had to use conditional rendering to wait for the state of the data to change so I could call D3.
